# ✨ Magic Photo Service

## 🚀 Real Estate Assistant Platform

MajicAgent is the command center for real estate professionals—an agent-first platform that connects every Majic component into one frictionless experience. The suite currently ships with:

- **Majic Photo Studio** – AI-powered staging and photo enhancements.
- **Listing Command Center** – Task automation, document vault, and marketing copy generation.
- **Majic Messenger** *(waitlist)* – Orchestrated email/SMS follow-up journeys.
- **Market Insights** *(preview)* – Predictive analytics for listings and retention.

Every module reads from the same agent graph (leads, listings, tasks, artifacts) so data never silos.

### Local Development

```bash
cp env.example .env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
docker compose up --build
```

- Backend runs on `http://localhost:4004` and uses MongoDB plus MinIO (S3 compatible) for local artifact storage.
- Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server) and targets the backend API. Update `frontend/.env` to point at production hosts when ready.
- Provide valid credentials for Google OAuth, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Akamai Object Storage in `.env` to unlock AI copy generation and secure storage flows.

> Legacy static assets now live in `frontend-legacy/`. Set `SERVE_LEGACY_FRONTEND=true` in `.env` if you need the previous experience served directly from the backend container.

> Save time, cut costs, and reduce stress with professional, AI-powered Real Estate photography.
> We transform simple Real Estate images into captivating, ready-to-use photos without the hassle of a traditional photoshoot.
